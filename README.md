Hello there!

Welcome to my github page, my name is Agnar Davíð or @agnardavid
I'm currently a freshman in computer science at Reykjavik University in Iceland. I recently graduated with a BA degree in audio engineering from SAE Institute in Amsterdam
and a diploma from Studio Syrland in Reykjavik. My goal is to somehow intertwine these two passions I have, programming and computer science being recently acquired 
while creating a video game at SAE and audio engineering being a passion since highschool. Hopefully these interests will also intertwine with my passion for video games 
and will my focus be on game design during the current study in CS.

On github I'll be keeping a history of my projects as I progress through the steep learning curve.
