Hello there!

Welcome to my github page, my name is Agnar Davíð. 
I'm currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Reykjavik University in Iceland and I hold a BA degree in audio engineering from SAE Institute in Amsterdam
as well as a diploma in the same field from Studio Syrland in Reykjavik. I became fascinated with programming while creating a video game at SAE called Rust N' Dust (steam link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721410/Rust_n_Dust/). 

On github I'll be keeping a history of my projects as I progress through the steep learning curve.


My current projects are as follows (some may not have been released yet on github):

Darts competition app

Digitalization of my current workplace using Python's various modules with Excel, Word, PDF and the AWS S3 Storage.
