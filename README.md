Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub page, my name is Agnar Davíð. 
I'm currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Reykjavik University in Iceland and I hold a BA degree in audio engineering from SAE Institute in Amsterdam as well as a diploma in the same field from Studio Syrland in Reykjavik. 
I became fascinated with programming during the creation of a video game at SAE called Rust N' Dust (steam link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721410/Rust_n_Dust/). 

On GitHub, I'll be keeping a history of my projects as I progress through the steep learning curve.


My current projects are as follows (some may not have been released yet on GitHub):

ExtLab - A file conversion app for Windows made using Python and Tkinter (Not on GitHub)


Previous projects:
* Curb-E - Self-driving robot prototype with a DC motor, a stepper motor, and an RGB sensor (Not on GitHub)
* Darts competition app
* Digitalization of my current workplace using conversion between Excel, Word, PDF, and an upload to the AWS S3 Storage.
